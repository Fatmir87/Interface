# Interface

 
Tony Montana Sound Program

Welcome to my interface.

It is a simple program that plays 2 wav sounds when clicked on.
The default sound on the interface is from the movie Scarface, Tony Montana.
When you press the big Play button you can listen to the wav sound you decide on and to the right you have a dropdown and when you click on the button you get to choose which wav sound you wish to select.
The code is very simple to read and easy to change if you want to for example to put more wav sound on it. The code is divided in 4 different classes to simplify it if you would wanna make any quick changes.

The code language is written i JAVA.

Enjoy the ride :)
